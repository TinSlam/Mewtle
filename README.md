# Mewtle
To use the engine, copy the contents of the "Engine" folder to an empty directory, set the project name in the "premake5.lua" file and run the "GenerateProject.bat" file.
A solution will be generated and an entry point for the game would be created as "EntryPoint.cpp" in the project directory.

Include "Mewtle.h" to access the engine. Should have all you need. Probably... 

A precompiled headers file will also be created for the project which can be modified to your preference. Doesn't have the most intuitive name though.
